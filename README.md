## Adaptive control of Parkinsonian patients' brain dynamics through Deep Brain Stimulation

The goals of the project were: (1) exploration of the existing methods in closed-loop control area in the framework of Parkinson disease in order to (2) propose a theoretical model of DBS controller. We aimed to (3) investigate ML algorithms which can potentially be used for system identification. Finally, we (4) implemented a simplified model of neuropathological system (5) to test system identification methods.

### Theoretical model of DBS controller
